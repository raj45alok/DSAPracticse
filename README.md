Data Structures & Algorithms Practice Repository

This repository contains my personal solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems that I solve regularly for practice and interview preparation.

The goal of this repository is to:

Strengthen problem-solving skills

Build consistency in DSA practice

Track progress over time

Prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming
